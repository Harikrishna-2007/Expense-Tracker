# 💼 Project Proposal: Desktop Expense Tracker using Python and Tkinter

## 🧩 Project Title
**Expense Tracker – Desktop Application (Python + Tkinter)**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a lightweight, user-friendly desktop application that allows users to easily track, manage, and analyze their daily expenses using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and data storage using SQLite.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced environment, individuals often struggle to manage personal finances and monitor daily expenses effectively. Mobile apps can be distracting or require internet connectivity and cloud accounts. There is a need for a **simple, offline, desktop-based** expense management system that:

- Logs expenses by date, category, and amount
- Stores data locally
- Provides quick summary reports and analytics
- Has an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

This project will deliver a **Tkinter-based GUI application** with the following features:

- **Add/Edit/Delete** expense entries
- **Calendar widget** for date selection (using `tkcalendar`)
- **Category dropdown** and description input
- **Local SQLite database** to store expense records
- **Treeview display** of expense logs
- **Summary report** showing total expenses by category/date
- **Pop-up alerts** for confirmations and errors
