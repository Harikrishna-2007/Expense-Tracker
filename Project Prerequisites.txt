To build this project, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.

a. messagebox – To display a box containing information, warning, or error or asking a question.

b. Ttk.Treeview – To display a table in the GUI window.

2. Tkcalender.DateEntry – To enter a date.

3. SQLite – To connect the Python script to the SQL database.

Only the Tkinter library comes pre-installed with Python, so you need to run the following command in your terminal to install them:

python -m pip install tkcalender sqlite
